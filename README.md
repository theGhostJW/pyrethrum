# Pyrethrum

This project is a work in progress is not close to being in a usable state.

When functional this will be a single library that provides an opinionated end
to end test framework using Haskell.

I am currently working on the framework workflow and base functionality such as
logging, test filtering and report generation. Integration with Webdriver, REST
services and property base testing will follow. This is what I would regard as
MVP.

Once the above is complete, comprehensive documentation will follow.
