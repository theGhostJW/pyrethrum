# Sadly this has to all be in a single RUN command so REPO_DIR can be used
# Docker does not directly support storing command output in variables within a Dockerfile as you might in a shell script. 
# The example combines commands using && to ensure they are executed in the same shell, 
# allowing the use of the variable ${REPO_DIR} within the scope of that RUN command.
